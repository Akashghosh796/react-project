        Steps: 'By parboiling the rice, the Biryani can be steamed instead of boiled. This renders the chicken tender and juicy. Marinating the chicken and then browning it ensures it is seasoned to the core while creating new layers of flavor thanks to Maillard browning. Properly caramelizing the onions adds loads of umami and it also lends a subtle sweetness thatâ€™s the perfect contrast to the savory and spicy chicken'
